### Who is Financeit?

Financeit is a market leading point-of-sale payment plan provider, focused on the home improvement industry, but also with clients in the vehicle and retail industries. Our innovative cloud-based technology makes it easy for merchants to increase close rates and transaction sizes with affordable monthly or bi-weekly payment plans. Financeit's platform features a fast, transparent application process and has approved over 8,000 merchant partners across Canada, received more than $3 billion in loan applications since launching in 2011. We’re a diverse and dynamic company with an open office environment that’s seeking the best and brightest. Financeit is small enough that you can make an impact within the company, and large enough to make an impact in the market.

### About the role

We are looking for an experienced CSR to take ownership of the roadmap for the Financeit Loan Servicing platform through leading the definition, execution, and roll-out of features that support the needs of our Customer Service, Collections, and Finance teams. We'd love to get to know you if you’re a detail oriented and analytical team player with a positive attitude and the experience to lead product development teams through all stages of the product lifecycle. You are also comfortable multi-tasking in a fast-paced and high-pressure startup environment, and hold yourself accountable for results. This position will report directly to the Director, Product Management and work closely with everyone on the Financeit team.
